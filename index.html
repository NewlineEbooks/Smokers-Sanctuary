                <p align="left"> <strong>RE: Freedom For Life</strong></p>
                <p align="left"> Dear Friend,</p>
                <p align="left"> Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; Addiction isn&rsquo;t something  that&rsquo;s formed on easy terms. And I don&rsquo;t blame you, sometimes our circumstances  such as our genetics, family background and social environments drive us into  addiction as a form of coping mechanism.</p>
                <p align="left"> And once we spiral into a maze of  negativity, it can be very hard to get out of our disempowering ways of  behavior.</p>
                <p align="left"> But here&rsquo;s the good news:</p>
                <p align="left"><strong>Addiction  is something that CAN be cured! You just need to have the right tools and  strategies for breaking it!</strong></p>
                <p align="left"> But before we go into that, ask yourself,  have you ever faced any of these problems in your life?</p>
                <p align="left"> <strong>-Feeling helpless and unable to act when it  comes to your addictions.<br>
                  -You lack the tools and strategies needed  for helping you overcome your urges and addictions.<br>
                  -You don&rsquo;t have a proper support system  needed to help you battle your cravings.<br>
                  -Or you are totally clueless when it comes  to dealing with your addiction.</strong></p>
                <p align="left"> Well, you are not alone. I&rsquo;ve once walked  down this lost path and I told myself that I would do whatever it takes to  figure out the key to freeing myself from addiction and living a life of  freedom.</p>
